# ADSORB: A Classifier of Recorded Specifications and User Feedback

ADSORB (A Classifier of Recorded Specifications and User Feedback) Tool - Version 1.0

Tool description:

In  the  context  of  digital  transformation,  speedingup  the  time-to-market  of  high-quality  software  products  is  a big  challenge.  Software  quality  correlates  with  the  success  of requirements engineering (RE) sessions and the ability to collect feedback  from  customers  in  an  efficient,  dynamic  way.  Thus, software  analysts  are  tasked  to  collect  all  relevant  material  of RE  sessions  and  user  feedback,  usually  specified  on  written notes,   flip   charts,   pictures,   and   (mobile   apps)   user   reviews. Afterwards comprehensible requirements need to be specified for software implementation and testing. These activities are mostly performed  manually,  which  causes  process  delays  and  software quality attributes like reliability, usability, comprehensibility, etc., are diminished causing software devaluation. This paper proposesa   tool,   called ADSORB (clAssifier   of   recorDed SpecificatiOns and  useR feedBack),  for  automating  the  tasks  of  requirements specification   and   user   feedback   analysis.   The   proposed   tool involves   computational   mechanisms   to   enable   the   automatic classification  of  requirements  discussed  in  RE  meetings  (storedin  form  of  audio  recordings)  and  textual  feedback  in  form  of user  reviews.  The  innovative  aspect ADSORB comes  from  the digitally  transformation  of  the  software  development  life  cycle (SDLC) requirements coming from real-world RE meetings anduser  reviews. ADSORB has  the  potential  to  renovate  the  role  of software  analysts,  which  can  experience  substantial  reduction of  manual  tasks,  more  efficient  communication,  dedication  tomore  analytical  tasks,  and  assurance  of  software  quality  from conception phases. Indeed, results of this work have shown that ADSORBis  able  to  automatically  exploits  machine  and  deep-learning  strategies  to  classify  RE  specifications  and  user  review feedback  with  reliable  accuracy.
